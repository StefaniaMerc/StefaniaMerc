## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software engineer driven by the thrill of solving complex problems. I enjoy looking for innovative solutions and ways for optimising existing systems.

Projects:
Job Tracker (https://github.com/StefaniaMerc/Job-Tracker): A web application designed to streamline the job search process. It helps users organise applications, track deadlines, and analyse their progress.

Currently, I'm diving deeper into data structures and algorithms to enhance my problem-solving skills and build more efficient software.
